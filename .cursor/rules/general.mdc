# Codebase-wide rules

## Technologies used

- `React.js` frontend with `Tailwind CSS` for styling
- `Express.js` backend
- `PostgreSQL` database
- `Redis` for session management (and caching when appropriate)
- Session cookie for authentication, not JWT

## Structure

### Backend (`/backend`)

- `config/` - Configure database, redis, etc.
- `controllers/`
- `middleware/` - Express middleware
- `models/` - One model file with SQL operations for each database table
- `routes/`
- `utils/`
- `server.js` - Server entry point

### Frontend (`/frontend`)

- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/pages/` - Full page components
- `src/utils/`
- `src/api.js` - Requests to the backend API
- `src/index.js` and `src/App.js` - Frontend entry points

## Code style

### Casing

- `camelCase` for JavaScript variables, functions, props, keys, etc.
- `PascalCase` for components and classes
- `snake_case` for database columns

### Naming

- Refer to variables that represent the same data by the same name across the stack as much as possible
- Names should be as concise as possible while still being adequately descriptive

### Ordering

- Order alphabetically when order is negligible (e.g., imports, object keys, component props, function arguments, etc.)
